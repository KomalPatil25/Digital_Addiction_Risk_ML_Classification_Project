## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

The application uses a **Random Forest classifier** trained on digital behavior and lifestyle features:

- Screen Time Hours  
- Social Media Usage  
- Sleep Duration  
- Physical Activity  
- App Unlock Frequency  

The model classifies users into:

- 🟢 Low Risk  
- 🟡 Moderate Risk  
- 🔴 High Risk

## 🖥️ Web Interface

The UI is built using **Flask + HTML + CSS** with modern design elements:

- Glassmorphism card layout  
- Gradient background  
- Hover animations  
- Animated prediction cards  
- Responsive grid form

## 📊 Input Parameters

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
Screen Time | Daily screen usage (hours) |
Social Media | Social media usage (hours) |
Sleep Hours | Daily sleep duration |
Physical Activity | Activity minutes per day |
App Unlocks | Phone unlock frequency |

---

## 📈 Prediction Logic

Digital addiction risk increases with:

- Higher screen time  
- Higher social media usage  
- More phone unlocks  

Risk decreases with:

- Better sleep  
- More physical activity
